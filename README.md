 limitation of  ttext classification using deep learning:
1. deep learning models are trained in a batch learning setting with the entire training data. So it is cumbersome when used in a continual learning setting because storing previous text data is a memory expensive task
1. Second, it is difficult to obtain total sufficient labeled samples for text classification with deep learning at the beginning because the labeling cost is prohibitively expensive or they do not occur frequently enough to be collected
1. model performances highly depend on the distribution of the data samples. The distribution of the previous datasets might differ from that of the newly collected data, which might lead to overfitting.
